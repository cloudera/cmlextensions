# cml-extensions

This python library has added functionality for [Cloudera Machine Learning (CML)](https://docs.cloudera.com/machine-learning/cloud/product/topics/ml-product-overview.html#cdsw_overview)'s cml (or legacy cdsw) library. The library is organized in modules and is built on the [CML Workers API](https://docs.cloudera.com/machine-learning/cloud/distributed-computing/topics/ml-workers-api.html) and other CML functionalities.

## Installation
This library can be installed directly from GitHub:

```%pip install git+https://github.com/cloudera/cmlextras.git```

## Modules

### Ray
Ray is a unified framework for scaling AI and Python applications. We can create a cluster on CML infrastructure to scale out Ray processes. This `cmlextras.ray_cluster` module abstracts the ray cluster provisioning and operations so users can focus on their application code instead of infrastructure management.

Example usage:
```
> from cmlextras.ray_cluster import RayCluster

> cluster = RayCluster(num_workers=2)
> cluster.init()

--------------------
Ray cluster started
--------------------

The Ray dashboard is running at
https://024d0wpuw0eain8r.ml-4c5feac0-3ec.go01-dem.ylcu-atmi.cloudera.site/

To connect to this Ray cluster from this CML Session,
use the following Python code:
  import ray
  ray.init(address='ray://100.100.127.74:10001')

```

### Dask
Dask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytics in Python. We can create a cluster on CML infrastructure to scale out Dask processes. This `cmlextras.dask_cluster` module abstracts the dask cluster provisioning and operations so users can focus on their application code instead of infrastructure management.

Example usage:
```
> from cmlextras.dask_cluster import DaskCluster

> cluster = DaskCluster(num_workers=2)
> cluster.init()

--------------------
Dask cluster started
--------------------

The Dask dashboard is running at
https://024d0wpuw0eain8r.ml-4c5feac0-3ec.go01-dem.ylcu-atmi.cloudera.site/

To connect to this Dask cluster from this CML Session,
use the following Python code:
  from dask.distributed import Client
  client = Client('tcp://100.100.225.149:8786')
```

### Workers_v2
The cml (or legacy cdsw) library has a workers module already. The v2 module is experimenting with a new management interface for the CML Workers infrastructure. The v2 module has more defaults and a more OOP approach for managing groups of workers. There is no added functionality, the v2 library relies on the functionality available in the orignal version.

Example usage:
```
> import cmlextras.workers_v2 as workers
> from cmlextras.workers_v2 import WorkerGroup

> wg1 = WorkerGroup(1, code="import time;time.sleep(300)")
> wg1.get_workers()
id	status	created_at	running_at	finished_at	duration	ip_address

> workers.get_workers(active=True)

> wg1.stop_workers()
```
